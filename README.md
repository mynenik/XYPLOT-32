# XYPLOT-32
Extensible Plotting and Data Analysis Program for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux

## Introduction
XYPLOT is an extensible plotting and data analysis program for use by students, teachers, scientists, and engineers. It displays the results from your experiments or calculations in an interactive graphical environment. Fast plotting and a myriad of data manipulation and analysis features make XYPLOT an invaluable tool for visualizing and working with data. With its powerful, built-in Forth interpreter, users may write custom modules to add new data manipulation and analysis functions, and even data-acquisition functions accessible from menus. Many of XYPLOT's built-in functions are provided in the form of Forth source modules which are loaded upon startup. For generating publication quality graphs, a module provides the capability to export graphs to Grace.

## Features

* Fast and easy to use with minimal fuss in loading and plotting a dataset from a file.
* Arbitrarily large datasets may be loaded from files.
* Powerful built-in kForth environment permits loading Forth source modules.
* Selection of plot colors and symbols.
* Continuous display of x,y cursor coordinates.
* Multi-level zoom in/out to examine features of interest.
* Modify x or y values of a dataset using simple algebraic expressions.
* View and edit dataset headers.
* Compatible with DOS and Windows XYPLOT dataset files and workspace files.

## System Requirements

GNU/Linux system (x86 or x86_64), with the following package groups installed:

  X-Windows development
  GNU C and C++ development
  Motif/LessTif development
  GNU bintools

A specific list of packages will be provided in the documentation. On a 64-bit (x86_64) workstation, the corresponding i686 libraries must be installed also, in order to buid XYPLOT-32.
